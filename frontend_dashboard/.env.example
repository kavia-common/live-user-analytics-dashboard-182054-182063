# Frontend .env example
# Single-host mode is default: the app will call the backend at the same origin using /api and connect Socket.io at /socket.io.
# You do NOT need to set these variables for single-host deployments.

# For split-host local development (frontend :3000, backend :4000), uncomment and set:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
# REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:4000
# REACT_APP_SOCKET_PATH=/socket.io

# Frontend environment example
# By default, the frontend uses SAME-ORIGIN to reach the backend.
# This means axios uses '' as baseURL and requests like '/api/*' go to the same host/domain.
# Socket.IO also defaults to same-origin with path '/socket.io'.
#
# You can override these defaults using the variables below if you deploy frontend and backend on different origins.

# Optional: Full API base URL override. If set, include protocol and domain (and path if needed).
# Example: https://api.myapp.com or https://api.myapp.com/api
REACT_APP_API_URL=

# Optional: Full Socket.IO URL override. If unset, socket connects to same origin.
# Example: https://api.myapp.com
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=

# Optional: Socket.IO path. Defaults to '/socket.io'.
REACT_APP_SOCKET_PATH=/socket.io

# Other app-related variables (if needed by Auth or other services)
